## 6. PERSUASIVE MARKETING PLAN

### Core Persuasion Strategy

#### The "Legacy Gap" Problem
**Challenge:** Most business owners build successful companies but have no plan for what happens next.

**Solution Framework:** The 4 L's of Legacy
1. **Leadership** - Develop leaders who can run the business without you
2. **Leverage** - Create systems that scale beyond your personal capacity
3. **Longevity** - Build a business that outlasts any individual
4. **Legacy** - Create impact that extends beyond profit

### Persuasive Messaging Framework

#### Level 1: Attention (Hook)
*"What happens to your business when you're not there?"*

**Emotional Trigger:** Fear + Curiosity
**Goal:** Get them to think about succession

#### Level 2: Interest (Value Proposition)
*"Legacy 83 helps business owners build companies that thrive today AND endure for generations—with measurable results in 90 days."*

**Emotional Trigger:** Hope + Possibility
**Goal:** Get them to ask "How?"

#### Level 3: Desire (Proof & Differentiation)
*"Our G.R.O.W.S. framework has helped owners double profits, build leadership teams, and create real exit plans. One client said: 'I finally sleep at night knowing my business has a future.'"*

**Emotional Trigger:** Belief + FOMO
**Goal:** Get them to want this for themselves

#### Level 4: Action (Clear Next Step)
*"Take the free Legacy Growth IQ™ Quiz and discover what's standing between you and the future you deserve."*

**Emotional Trigger:** Safety + Urgency
