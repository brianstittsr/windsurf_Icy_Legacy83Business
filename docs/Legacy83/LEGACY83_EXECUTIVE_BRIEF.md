## Company Overview

Legacy 83 Business is a business coaching and consulting firm headquartered at 4724 Vine Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45217. Founded by Icy Williams, the company operates under a clear mission: empowering business leaders to build wealth, inspire teams, and leave lasting legacies. With over two decades of experience helping business leaders unlock their potential, Icy Williams established Legacy 83 after witnessing countless talented entrepreneurs struggle not from lack of vision, but from lack of strategic execution.

The company differentiates itself through its proprietary Legacy Growth System, known as the G.R.O.W.S. framework—a five-step methodology designed to help small business owners grow sustainably, strengthen leadership capabilities, and prepare for succession. This framework addresses a critical gap in the market: while most business coaches focus exclusively on growth metrics, Legacy 83 uniquely combines strategic growth planning with succession readiness, helping owners build companies that thrive today and endure for generations.

## Service Portfolio

Legacy 83 delivers value through four core service offerings. Strategic Planning provides vision-aligned roadmaps that connect daily decisions to long-term legacy goals, encompassing business vision development, goal setting and tracking, strategic roadmapping, and performance metrics. Leadership Coaching transforms leadership skills to empower teams and inspire change through executive coaching, team leadership development, communication skills enhancement, and conflict resolution. Operational Excellence streamlines systems to reclaim time and improve margins via process optimization, system implementation, efficiency analysis, and cost reduction strategies. Finally, Legacy Transition addresses the critical need for succession planning, business valuation, exit strategy development, and knowledge transfer—ensuring business owners can step away confidently when the time comes.

## Market Opportunity

The U.S. business coaching market represents a substantial opportunity, estimated at $20 billion in 2025 and growing at 4.5% annually. The global coaching industry has expanded 62% since 2019 and is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2032. Legacy 83 is positioned to capture market share by addressing an underserved segment: small business owners with 5-50 employees generating $500,000 to $10 million in annual revenue, particularly those aged 40-65 who are concerned about succession and exit strategies.

The competitive landscape includes established players such as ActionCOACH (franchise-based coaching at $1,000-$3,500/month), EOS Worldwide (Entrepreneurial Operating System implementation at $5,000-$15,000/quarter), Vistage (CEO peer advisory groups at $1,500-$2,500/month), and regional competitors like Aileron in Dayton, Ohio. Legacy 83's competitive advantages include its legacy-first philosophy, the proprietary G.R.O.W.S. framework, a 90-day results promise, founder-led personal approach with direct access to Icy Williams, holistic business and life integration, accessible pricing for small businesses, and the Legacy Growth IQ™ assessment tool that provides immediate value before any paid engagement.

## Target Market Profile

The ideal customer for Legacy 83 is a small business owner operating a company with 5-50 employees, generating $500,000 to $10 million in annual revenue, with a business age of 3-20 years. These owners, typically aged 40-65, are feeling stuck or plateaued in growth, working in the business rather than on it, and increasingly concerned about succession and exit strategy. They value family and legacy over pure profit, are ready to invest in themselves and their business, and are open to coaching and accountability.

Common pain points include being the bottleneck in their own business, lacking a leadership team they can trust, having no clear path to exit or transition, working 60+ hours weekly without corresponding growth, and recognizing that their business would collapse without them. Trigger events that prompt engagement include approaching retirement age (55+), health scares or significant life events, key employee departures, growth plateaus lasting two or more years, desire for more family time, and active consideration of selling the business.

Industries with the highest potential include professional services (accounting, legal, consulting, marketing agencies), healthcare practices (dental, medical, therapy, veterinary), construction and trades (general contractors, specialty trades), manufacturing (small job shops, custom manufacturers), and family businesses (multi-generational companies).

**Tier 1 (Immediate Outreach - 15 Companies):** These high-priority prospects include owners aged 50+ with clear succession needs and 20+ employees.

## Marketing Strategy

The marketing approach centers on the "Legacy Gap" problem—the reality that most business owners build successful companies but have no plan for what happens next. The solution framework addresses the 4 L's of Legacy: Leadership (developing leaders who can run the business independently), Leverage (creating systems that scale beyond personal capacity), Longevity (building a business that outlasts any individual), and Legacy (creating impact that extends beyond profit).

The multi-channel campaign includes content marketing through The Legacy Journal blog with topics like "5 Signs Your Business Would Collapse Without You" and "The Succession Planning Checklist Every Owner Needs"; LinkedIn strategy with optimized profile, content pillars, and engagement tactics; email marketing with the Legacy Growth IQ™ Quiz as the primary lead magnet followed by a five-email nurture sequence; local networking through Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber, SCORE Cincinnati, and Family Business Center at Xavier University; and strategic partnerships with CPAs, business attorneys, financial advisors, and business brokers who encounter succession needs in their client base.
